                ),
                content="""## The Problem

Traditional API gateways and WAFs match known attack signatures. They miss novel abuse patterns — credential stuffing sequences, business-logic exploits, and slow-burn scraping — because these look like legitimate traffic individually.

## The Architecture

I designed a middleware pipeline with 10+ independent components that each score a request independently:

- **Trust Scorer** — maintains a rolling reputation score per IP / API key
- **Behavioral Analyzer** — detects anomalous request sequences (not just individual requests)
- **Policy Evaluator** — maps scores to actions (allow, throttle, block, challenge)
- **Adaptive Enforcer** — automatically adjusts thresholds based on traffic patterns

Each component is stateless in itself; shared state lives in Redis with short TTLs.

## Why Redis?

Synchronous DB reads per request would kill latency. Redis gives sub-millisecond state reads, and because behavioral state is ephemeral (24-hour windows), Redis's eviction policies are a feature, not a bug.

## Results

- **16–20 ms** average added latency (well within SLA for most APIs)
- Zero false positives in testing at normal traffic volumes
- Blocked 100% of simulated credential-stuffing sequences in load tests

## Lessons Learned

1. Async processing is non-negotiable for security middleware
2. Modular components enable A/B testing of enforcement strategies
3. The React monitoring dashboard proved essential — security without observability is guesswork

                ),
                content="""## Starting Point

I needed an auth system that was modular, testable, and fast under real load. Most tutorials gave me either a toy or a monolith.

## The Module Breakdown

```
auth/
├── hashing.py       # bcrypt, abstracted behind an interface
├── tokens.py        # JWT issuance + refresh token rotation
├── roles.py         # RBAC decorators for FastAPI routes
├── email.py         # Verification flow, token expiry
└── cache.py         # Redis session layer
```

## The 3× DB Reduction

Every authenticated request previously hit the DB to validate the session. With Redis:

1. On login, store `{token_hash: user_id + roles}` in Redis (TTL = access token lifetime)
2. On each request, check Redis first — DB only on cache miss
3. On logout / token rotation, invalidate the Redis key

This pattern reduces DB calls to: initial login + explicit invalidations only.

## Load Testing with Locust

```python
class AuthUser(HttpUser):
    @task
    def authenticate(self):
        self.client.post("/auth/login", json={...})
        self.client.get("/protected/resource")
```

Results at 800 concurrent users: **p95 < 45 ms**, zero 5xx errors.

## Key Takeaways

- Cache at the session-validation layer, not the business-logic layer
- Test with realistic concurrency early — bottlenecks are never where you expect
- Token rotation on every refresh is worth the extra Redis write for security

                ),
                content="""## Why Mental Health Chatbots Are Hard

Standard text generation models optimize for coherence, not safety. A model trained on Reddit data will occasionally generate responses that sound reasonable but are actively harmful for someone in crisis.

## The Safety Architecture

I separated generation from safety into two independent systems:

1. **Generator (T5)** — produces a candidate response given context
2. **Safety Scorer (Sentence Transformers + sentiment)** — scores the candidate on a 0–1 scale
3. **Gate** — if safety score < 0.85, regenerate with a stricter prompt prefix

This lets each component be improved independently.

## Dataset Preparation

```python
# Context-response pairs from curated mental health datasets
pairs = [
    {"context": "I've been feeling really hopeless lately", 
     "response": "I hear you — that heaviness is real. Can you tell me more about what's been happening?"},
    ...
]
# NLP preprocessing: normalize, remove PII, tokenize with T5Tokenizer
```

## Results

- **99.2% safety rate** across 5,000 test conversations
- Context-aware responses vs. keyword-matching baselines
- Semantic retrieval added 12% relevance improvement over pure generation

## What I'd Do Differently

Use a smaller model (T5-small → distilT5) for faster inference. The safety layer adds ~80 ms; with a smaller backbone, total latency would drop under 200 ms even on CPU.
